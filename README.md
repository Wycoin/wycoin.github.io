### The "Problem"
Ever heard of decentralized banking? What about Bitcoin? Sure you have.

So Bitcoin is this currency that runs on a decentralized banking system. Decentralized banking is basically the idea
of peer-to-peer banking as oppose to having a centralized structure where the is one central power; the bank.

Bitcoin is getting widely adopted and its decentralized which means its so much more secure and reliable. So... Whats
not cool about it? Well say you'd like to buy some Bitcoin today. You'd probably do that  with a wallet provider because
setting up your own stuff is way too complicated. But because so many people go to a wallet provider there is a centralized
system within the bigger decentralized system that is Bitcoin.

### The Solution

Thats what we're trying to solve with Wycoin. It makes it easy for anyone to become part of the system and makes sure
there are no miners needed like with Bitcoin so really every part of the system is and stays decentralised.

1. What. Kind of like Bitcoin but easier to set up and truly decentralized.
2. Nodes. Nodes which are basically like citizens (anyway can become a citizen) in a country who know everything about eachother. If one of the citizens does something illigal the others wont approve.
3. Wallet. So you have this system but how to tap into it. Anyone can start a node. Using the wallet CLI you can create an account in the system and start transferring money.
4. Insight. You can look into what the system is doing.
5. Show. `wyllet balance`. Current balance is x.
6. Now I want to transfer some money to my friend: `wyllet t 10 c9964180079ef2c3e270be2c06eaa62efaa2359dbfa066395dfcfd2dc2df3bf5`.
7. `wyllet balance`. Works!
8. Now how does this work?
9. Its quite simply. If I want to transfer money other nodes or citizens will look into their big book of finance and see if they agree. If they do the transfer comes true. That way you get truely decentralized banking.
10. And there you have it. Decentralized banking by Wycoin. Thank you for watching.
